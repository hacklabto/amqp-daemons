amqp-daemons
============

A collection of small daemons that route messages between queues and in/out of the AMQP system at HackLab.TO.
These do all the routing between things like the door and the sign, the power monitoring and the other sign, the door and
twitter, etc. Also useful things like making ostriches walk across the LED sign.
